    description: I’m currently working a series of contracts for AudioVerse building a WordPress plugin which
      reproduces the functionality of their current website. Goals are to make the website easier to update for their
      non-technical staff and to eventually take advantage of PWA browser APIs to reduce their reliance on maintaining
      separate mobile apps. Locally I use Docker as <a href='https://github.com/AVORG/wp-avorg-dev'>my development
      environment</a>.
- organization: SimpleUpdates.com

  projects:
    - title: CircleCI configuration
      tags:
        - docker
        - circleci
      description: I was responsible for configuring CircleCI to run tests for our internal CMS’ codebase, along with
        configuration for each of the themes we make available to our customers. The CI configuration for the CMS uses
        a dockerfile which builds to the Docker Hub, which has greatly increased the speed of our CI jobs.

        - database-design
      description: I rebuilt the system SimpleUpdates maintains to generate free static websites for churches who don’t
        currently have a website. This involved setting up a database, router, and a system to talk to eAdventist’s API
        to retrieve churches that didn’t have a website, register them in the database so we would serve a website for
        them, and then notify eAdventist so they could update their entry for that church in their database.
