  description: I’m currently working a series of contracts for AudioVerse building a WordPress plugin which
    reproduces the functionality of their current website. Goals are to make the website easier to update for their
    non-technical staff and to eventually take advantage of PWA browser APIs to reduce their reliance on maintaining
    separate mobile apps. Locally I use Docker as <a href='https://github.com/AVORG/wp-avorg-dev'>my development
    environment</a>.
- title: Theme Front-End Component Library
  image: https://picsum.photos/400?random&bust=2
  tags:
  - twig
  - less
  description: I architected and implemented a component library that allowed all our themes to share the most
    complex pieces of code such as our carousel and navigation system. In the process I was able to turn this code
    into components which were much more robust and customizable for the themes using them.
- title: CircleCI configuration
  tags:
  - docker
  - circleci
  description: I was responsible for configuring CircleCI to run tests for our internal CMS’ codebase, along with
    configuration for each of the themes we make available to our customers. The CI configuration for the CMS uses
    a dockerfile which builds to the Docker Hub, which has greatly increased the speed of our CI jobs.

  description: I rebuilt the system SimpleUpdates maintains to generate free static websites for churches who don’t
    currently have a website. This involved setting up a database, router, and a system to talk to eAdventist’s API
    to retrieve churches that didn’t have a website, register them in the database so we would serve a website for
    them, and then notify eAdventist so they could update their entry for that church in their database.
