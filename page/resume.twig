		The intersection between technology and human cognition has always fascinated me. What can we learn from the
		brain that we can apply to technology? How does technology impact human behavior? How can we harness the power
		of technology to help people make positive changes in their lives? These are the questions that inspire me.

		I was drawn to the Internet as a medium of communication before I went away to academy. Just the idea that I
		could create something online that other people could see, my own website, was strangely compelling to me. I
		built my first website using Yahoo! GeoCities when I was fourteen years old. Since that day, I've continued to
		learn new skills related to web development and design.

		Since that time, my interests have grown to include the human mind and behavior. Through reading books and
		watching lectures, a curiosity as to the causes of behavioral addictions has enlarged to encompass neurology,
		psychology, and behavioral therapy, as well as how these topics circle back and connect to the world of
		technology and the Internet.
